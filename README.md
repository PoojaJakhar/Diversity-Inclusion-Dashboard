# Diversity-Inclusion-Dashboard
The project involved analyzing employee data related to demographics, promotions, turnover rates, and regional diversity. I designed an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics, helping stakeholders understand the organization's diversity landscape.The project enhanced my skills in data modeling, visualization, and Power BI, while also providing valuable insights into promoting a more inclusive workplace.
